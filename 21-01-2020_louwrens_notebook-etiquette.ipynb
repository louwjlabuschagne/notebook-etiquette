    "Why a session on notebook etiquette? Because it is important, really important! Knowing when to use which tool in your programming arsenal makes the difference between completing a task in 1 day vs taking 5 days and still things are wonky.\n",

    "IDE's like Atom, VS Code, Sublime Text are great, and they have their place, don't get me wrong. Similarly, notebooks are great, but also have their place along with pro's and con's for certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important difference for me personally, is that notebooks should be _more_ than code, much more! If you just want to run your code from top to bottom, then use a script - seriously you'll be beter off. No more forgetting about which cells ran first or having to deal with variables having rando values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are more than scripts! And should be treated as such. Think of a notebook as a report or an essay, or even a piece of art, if you like. Eitherway, your notebooks are a piece of you that you put into the world and you should be proud of them. Difficult to do if it's just code cells that barely run top to bottom... \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be thinking, but I just want to code and get the job done. And I hear you. However, I would like to convice you that spicing up your notebooks don't need to take any _more_ time than you're currenlty spending on your notebooks. How? Easily, you know those times where you are waiting for data from a DB - scroll up to the top of your notebook and **start refactoring!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is this great small excerises in refactoring code, but your notebook just keeps improving everytime your queries start running. In other words, no extra time spent on your notebook, but the quality has increase tremendiously."

    "There are no perfect solutions here, but the idea is for you and your team to choose a format **and stick to it!**\n",
    "\n",
    "A good suggestion I've encountered and I've standarised my workflow to include, is naming notebooks in the format: `date_user_name`. For example, this notebook's name is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "21-01-2020_louwrens_notebook-etiquette.ipynb\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons for this naming convension - especially if you're working in teams. Originally, I tried to keep track of which notebook follows on which by including a number before hand, as in: `1_name1.ipynb` and `2_name2.ipynb`. As soon as I started working in a team and people were naming 3 notebooks starting with `1_` it wasn't a viable option anymore. With the above format, the progression of notebook development is also captured by the date, and along with the user it is easy to trace back which notebook follows on which.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great advantage of standising not only notebooks, but all your team's files in this format, is that you can filter notebooks easily in the CLI. For example, if I wanted all the notebooks for January I could pipe my notebook folder to grep. I've created a example-notebooks directory with 4 files:"

    "Instantly we've gotten our thought together and realised that `calc_area` is maybe a bad name, perhaps `calc_area_rect`, or `calc_area(a,b,type='rect')` could work better. But the idea is that if you define what your function must do before you write it, you don't juse mindlesly jump in and start tinkering. Rather, you know where you're going, and more importantly when you've arrived.\n",

That way you can just read in this pickle in your next notebook, and you don't have to rerun all the code in this notebook. But, if you would like to rerun the analsyis for a different period, then you can rerun both notebooks in order. \n",
